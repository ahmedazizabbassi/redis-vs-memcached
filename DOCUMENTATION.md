## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Pattern
The project follows a **modular, interface-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── Config/           # Configuration management
├── Models/           # Data transfer objects
├── Utils/            # Utility functions and calculations
├── Cache/            # Cache adapter implementations
└── Benchmark/        # Core benchmarking logic
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Interface-Based Design**: `CacheAdapterInterface` ensures consistent API across Redis and Memcached implementations
2. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with CLI overrides
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive metrics including percentiles, throughput, and memory usage
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error tracking and reporting
5. **Modular Testing**: Each benchmark scenario is isolated and configurable

### Performance Metrics Collected

- **Latency**: Average, min, max, P50, P95, P99 percentiles
- **Throughput**: Operations per second
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory consumption
- **Error Rates**: Connection failures and operation errors
- **Statistical Analysis**: Standard deviation, coefficient of variation

## Installation and Setup Process

### Prerequisites Resolution
The most challenging aspect was installing the PHP memcached extension on macOS. The solution involved:

1. **Manual Compilation**: Downloaded and compiled memcached extension from source
2. **Path Configuration**: Specified correct paths for zlib and libmemcached libraries
3. **Extension Loading**: Added extension to PHP configuration

### Commands Executed
```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install zlib libmemcached redis memcached

# Compile memcached extension
cd /tmp
curl -O https://pecl.php.net/get/memcached-3.3.0.tgz
tar -xzf memcached-3.3.0.tgz
cd memcached-3.3.0
phpize
./configure --with-php-config=/opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.2/bin/php-config \
           --with-libmemcached-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/libmemcached \
           --with-zlib-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/zlib \
           --enable-memcached-sasl=yes \
           --enable-memcached-session=yes
make && sudo make install

# Enable extension
echo "extension=memcached.so" | sudo tee -a /opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.2/php.ini

# Install project dependencies
composer install
```
